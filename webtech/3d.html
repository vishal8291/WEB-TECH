            the interests of Indians under British rule. The INC became the main force of the Indian independence
            movement,led by prominent figures such as Mahatma Gandhi,Jawaharlal Nehru,and Bal Gangadhar Tilak.</p>

    DESCRIPTION: As a student delving into the world of web development, understanding and implementing timelines using HTML, CSS, and even JavaScript is a valuable skill that can be applied to showcase various aspects of one's journey, be it academic or professional.

A timeline event is essentially a visual representation of information or data points arranged in chronological order. Think of it as a digital scrapbook, where you can meticulously display your work history, achievements, or significant milestones in a structured and visually appealing manner.

In the realm of timelines, there exists a variety of types, each catering to different needs. There are horizontal timelines, vertical timelines, static ones that offer a fixed display, and interactive timelines that engage users with dynamic features. The choice of the type of timeline depends on the nature, quantity, and complexity of the data you aim to present.

To embark on creating a timeline using HTML and CSS, one must harness the power of specific HTML tags and CSS properties. These tools allow you to establish the fundamental structure and style of your timeline, ensuring it aligns with your aesthetic preferences and the information you wish to convey. CSS can be especially handy for tailoring the appearance of your timeline elements, such as colors, fonts, and spacing.

Furthermore, for those seeking to elevate their timelines to a new level of interactivity and functionality, JavaScript comes into play. By incorporating JavaScript, you can add dynamic features, such as hover effects, interactive buttons, or even the ability to toggle between different views of the timeline. This not only enhances the user experience but also provides a more engaging and informative presentation of your journey.

In conclusion, as a student navigating the intricacies of web development, mastering the creation of timelines using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript opens up avenues for expressing your narrative in a visually compelling way. Whether it's documenting your academic achievements or showcasing your professional growth, timelines serve as a versatile tool to communicate your story effectively on the digital stage.</p>
